### Hi there üëã

I'm Vladimir, a 24-year-old residing in Slovakia. My expertise lies in full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript development, where my focus is on delivering projects that are fast, secure, and impressive. Besides my professional endeavors, I also embrace the role of a loving father to two wonderful children. During my free time, I thoroughly enjoy spending quality moments with them.
